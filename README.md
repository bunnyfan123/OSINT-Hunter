# OSINT Hunter

## Overview
OSINT Hunter is an advanced AI-powered Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool designed for large-scale intelligence gathering, real-time threat profiling, and counter-disinformation warfare. This tool utilizes AI-driven automation, botnets, and geopolitical analysis to provide actionable intelligence.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Threat Actor Profiling**: Tracks cybercriminals, nation-state APT groups, and adversaries.
- **Global OSINT Botnets**: Deploys AI-powered botnets to gather intelligence across distributed networks.
- **Disinformation Warfare Detection**: AI-powered analysis of fake news and information warfare campaigns.
- **Geopolitical Intelligence Reports**: Generates reports on global conflicts and threats.
- **Web Scraping for Intelligence Data**: Collects data from public sources and news websites.
- **Flask Web Dashboard**: Displays OSINT results in a user-friendly web interface.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

- Analyze threat actors
- Deploy AI OSINT botnets
- Detect disinformation
- Generate intelligence reports
- Start the Flask web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Configuration
Modify the `osint_hunter.py` file to adjust settings:
```python
THREADS = 5000  # Max concurrent threads
TIMEOUT = 2  # Request timeout in seconds
REAL_TIME_THREAT_PROFILING = True  # Enable AI threat profiling
AUTONOMOUS_INTELLIGENCE_AGENCY = True  # Enable autonomous AI decision-making
GLOBAL_AI_OSINT_BOTNETS = True  # Enable AI-powered OSINT botnets
DISINFORMATION_WARFARE = True  # Enable disinformation detection
OUTPUT_FILE = "osint_hunter_unstoppable_results.json"
```

## Web Dashboard
Once the tool runs, access the OSINT dashboard at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
It displays collected intelligence data and insights.

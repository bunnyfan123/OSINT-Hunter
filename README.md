# OSINT Hunter: AI-Powered Open-Source Intelligence Tool

**OSINT Hunter** is a multi-functional, AI-powered tool designed to gather, analyze, and visualize open-source intelligence (OSINT) data from publicly available sources. It leverages advanced AI models for threat actor profiling, disinformation detection, geopolitical reporting, and distributed intelligence gathering. The tool also includes a Flask-based web dashboard for visualizing collected data.

---

## **Features**

1. **Threat Actor Profiling**:
   - Uses AI to track and analyze cybercriminals, APT groups, and state-sponsored hacking groups.
   - Generates detailed reports on threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

2. **Global OSINT Data Collection**:
   - Scrapes intelligence data from news websites, RSS feeds, and social media platforms.
   - Collects headlines, articles, and other relevant information.

3. **Disinformation Detection**:
   - Detects fake news, propaganda, and misinformation campaigns using AI-powered text classification.

4. **Geopolitical Intelligence Reporting**:
   - Generates AI-powered reports on global conflicts, risks, and geopolitical developments.

5. **Distributed OSINT Botnets**:
   - Deploys AI-powered botnets to gather intelligence from multiple sources simultaneously.

6. **Flask Web Dashboard**:
   - Visualizes collected OSINT data in a user-friendly web interface.

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osint-hunter.git
   cd osint-hunter
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download AI models (if not automatically downloaded):
   - The code uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library, which will download the required models automatically.

---

## **Usage**

### Running the Tool
1. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python osint_hunter.py
   ```

2. The tool will:
   - Collect OSINT data from predefined sources.
   - Profile threat actors (if enabled).
   - Detect disinformation in the collected data (if enabled).
   - Generate a geopolitical intelligence report (if enabled).
   - Launch a Flask web dashboard to visualize the results.

3. Access the Flask dashboard:
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:5000
     ```

### Customizing the Tool
- **Change Sources**: Modify the `sources` list in the `collect_osint()` function to include your preferred RSS feeds, websites, or social media queries.
- **Add New Features**: Integrate additional AI models or APIs for enhanced analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity recognition).
- **Scale Botnets**: Add more botnet servers to the `botnet_servers` list in the `launch_ai_osint_botnet()` function.

---

## **Configuration**

The tool can be configured by modifying the following variables in the script:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `THREADS`                       | Number of threads for concurrent OSINT data collection.                     |
| `TIMEOUT`                       | Timeout for web requests (in seconds).                                      |
| `REAL_TIME_THREAT_PROFILING`    | Enable/disable threat actor profiling.                                      |
| `AUTONOMOUS_INTELLIGENCE_AGENCY`| Enable/disable geopolitical intelligence reporting.                         |
| `GLOBAL_AI_OSINT_BOTNETS`       | Enable/disable distributed OSINT botnets.                                   |
| `DISINFORMATION_WARFARE`        | Enable/disable disinformation detection.                                    |
| `OUTPUT_FILE`                   | File to store collected OSINT data (default: `osint_hunter_results.json`).  |

## **Example Scenarios**

### 1. **Cybersecurity Threat Analysis**
   - Use the `ai_track_threat_actors()` function to profile hacking groups like "APT29" or "Lazarus Group."
   - Combine this with OSINT data to identify potential targets or campaigns.

### 2. **Fake News Detection**
   - Use the `detect_disinformation()` function to analyze news headlines or social media posts for signs of disinformation.
   - This can be useful for journalists, fact-checkers, or researchers.

### 3. **Geopolitical Risk Assessment**
   - Use the `generate_geopolitical_report()` function to generate a report on global conflicts or emerging risks.
   - This can help policymakers, analysts, or businesses make informed decisions.

### 4. **Distributed Intelligence Gathering**
   - Use the `launch_ai_osint_botnet()` function to gather intelligence about a specific target (e.g., a company or government agency).
   - This can be useful for competitive intelligence or threat hunting.

### 5. **Visualizing OSINT Data**
   - Use the Flask dashboard to visualize and interact with the collected data.
   - This can help analysts quickly identify trends or anomalies.

## **Limitations**

1. **Ethical Use**: Ensure that the tool is used responsibly and in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
2. **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of rate limits when scraping data from websites or APIs.
3. **Model Accuracy**: The accuracy of AI models depends on the quality of the training data and the specific use case.
4. **Resource Usage**: Running multiple threads or large AI models can be resource-intensive. Ensure your system has sufficient resources (e.g., CPU, RAM, GPU).
